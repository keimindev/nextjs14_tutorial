## Nextjs14 Master 

### Folder Structure
- public : image, media contents
- node_modules : dev libraries
- .next : cache,app,build folder
- src/app : app sources

### App Router
- react need a "router" for router
- nextjs use folder and file. folder name will be domain direction.
- child-folder also works. 
- dynamic routing use '[ sth ]' as folder name

### Layout
- The layout file will help in displaying the same components using props, even when changing the page.


### Image 
- Next.js caches images first and then optimizes them at different sizes.
- It doesn't showing image directly. 
- If you add an external image, you should include the protocol and hostname in next.config.js.
